# Description

A solution to solve the "maze" hard puzzle from the Codingame platform. 

It uses the BFS (breadth-first search) algorithm to navigate from cell A to cell B. 
The exploration is performed by selecting the move or cell that reveals the highest number of undiscovered cells (tagged by "?").

Note: this code intentionally contains errors to prevent copying and pasting and to maintain the integrity of the challenge.
